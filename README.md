# Number Guess Game (Python)

A simple and fun command‑line number guessing game built in Python! The computer randomly selects a number, and the player must guess it in the fewest attempts possible.

## Project Description

This project is a beginner‑friendly Python application where:

* The program generates a random number.
* The user attempts to guess it.
* The program provides hints such as `Higher` or `Lower`.
* The game ends when the user guesses correctly or exhausts all attempts.

This is perfect for beginners learning Python basics like loops, conditionals, and user input.
