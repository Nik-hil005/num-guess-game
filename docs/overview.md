**Project Overview**

The Number Guessing Game is a simple interactive Python program where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts. The game now includes three difficulty levels—Easy, Medium, and Hard—each affecting the guessing range and number of attempts.

This project was created as part of a beginner-friendly Python learning journey, focusing on core programming concepts such as:

* Loops
* Conditionals
* User input handling
* Random number generation
* Basic program flow control

The game runs entirely in the terminal and is suitable for users new to Python.
